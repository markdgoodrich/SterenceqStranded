	Here are the image files used for the backgrounds.  
These directories and images must be named accordingly:
For a series of backgrounds in a level, store them all in a single folder titled "lvlX", where X = the level number.
Each background must then be stored numerically, with the file name "Y.png", where Y is sequence number of the background: left-most background is 0, and it increments from there.


We'll need to find a way to handle Y coordiante movement at some point.
